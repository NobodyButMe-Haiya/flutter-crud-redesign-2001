this version only update flutter cupertino library  for crud purpose with backend api
this is not stable version yet both side. 

Youtube for flutter cupertino library will be soon be done. Material icon wouldn't see nice in apple and got white background. 

You can see both material and cupertino code is totally diff and seem like we write twice  for same functionality except backend .
